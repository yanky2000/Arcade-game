# Frogger Game clone
===============================
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs).
The goal of the player is to score as much points as possible.


## Game launch

To run the application just open _index.html_ file in your browser (Google Chrome preferebly)

## How to play

Use arrow keys to move your player (up, down, left, right).

## Rules

Your goal is to reach the water. When you do, you receive 50 points. After that, player returns to the start square for another, a slightly more difficult round.

If a BUG hits you on the road, you loose 5points and return to the start square.

From time to time you will see a Princess passing by, she's your **Friend**. Try to catch up with her, and you'll get a GEM appeared on the screen for you as a reward. Only Princess makes gems.

Collecting GEMS is awesome! Not only it gives you some points, but it also reduces the number of BUGS in the game.

NOTE: you can't have less than 0 points, and there will always be at least 3 bugs to challenge you.


* GEMS:
	- orange gem: +15 points, -1 bug
	- green gem: +20 points, - 1 bug
	- blue gem: +35 points, -1 bug

Reaching the water: +50 points. +1 bug

Happy gaming!
