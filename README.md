## Rules

1. Points.
Your goal is to earn points. First way to do it is to reach the water - it will give you 50 points. After that, player returns to the start square for another, a slightly more difficult round. You can also collect gems (see item 4)

2. Enemies.
There are enemies in the game - BUGS! If a bug hits you on the road, you loose 5points and return to the start square. So try to avoid them.

3. Friends.
From time to time you will see a Princess passing by, she's your **Friend**. Try to catch up with her, and you'll get a GEM appeared on the screen for you as a reward. Only Princess makes gems.

4. Gems.
Collecting GEMS is awesome! Not only it'll give you some points, but it will also reduce the number of bugs in the game.

	NOTE: you can't have less than 0 points, and there will always be at least 3 bugs to challenge you.


* GEMS:
	- orange gem: +15 points, -1 bug
	- green gem: +20 points, - 1 bug
	- blue gem: +35 points, -1 bug

Reaching the water: +50 points. +1 bug

Happy gaming!
